# How to execute the spell check in project?
You can execute *mvn install* to build the project and the check action will be executed in validate step or you can execute below:

```
It will execute spell check for all text of UI element or properties of you custom
Note: This plugin support properties file, java, groovy by default.For xml, you should define which part contains text show in ui, so the plugin will figure out the text base on the definition.  
```
mvn spell-check-maven-plugin:list
```
It will list all text instead of check. We can use it to build your custom dictionary base on your domain common language with this list file.
Note: It will help the user to tuning the definition of xml ui or custom dictionary.

# How to find the result of spell check?
